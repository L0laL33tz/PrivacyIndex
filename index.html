      <div class="expanding-element hidden">Snowstorm is a decentralized, censorship resistant VPN based on the Tor Project's Snowflake protocol. Instead of connecting to a commercial VPN provider, whose IPs can easily be blocked in times of censorship, Snowstorm connects users to the computers of other people. In Snowflake, peers, who act as proxies, connect to the Internet via a Tor entry node. Snowstorm removes the need for the Tor network letting peers connect directly, making the connection much faster. </br></br>Learn more: <a href="https://mashable.com/article/snowstorm-beta-launch-anti-censorship-vpn-snowflake-tor" target="_blank">https://mashable.com/article/snowstorm-beta-launch-anti-censorship-vpn-snowflake-tor</a></br></br>Download: <a href="https://snowstorm.net/">https://snowstorm.net/</a></div>

From our sex lives to our workout routines, the details of our lives once relegated to pen and paper have joined the slipstream of new technology. As new technologies invite new violations, people have power over one another like never before, from revenge porn to blackmail, attaching life-altering risks to growing up, dating online, or falling in love. The Fight for Privacy takes the focus off Silicon Valley moguls to investigate the price we pay as technology migrates deeper into every aspect of our lives: entering our bedrooms and our bathrooms and our midnight texts; our relationships with friends, family, lovers, and kids; and even our relationship with ourselves.

      <div class="expanding-element hidden">The requirement of harm has significantly impeded the enforcement of privacy law. In most tort and contract cases, plaintiffs must establish that they have suffered harm. Even when legislation does not require it, courts have taken it upon themselves to add a harm element. Harm is also a requirement to establish standing in federal court. In Spokeo v. Robins and TransUnion v. Ramirez, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that courts can override congressional judgment about cognizable harm and dismiss privacy claims. This article makes two central contributions. The first is the construction of a typology for courts to understand harm so that privacy violations can be tackled and remedied in a meaningful way. Privacy harms consist of various different types, which to date have been recognized by courts in inconsistent ways. Our typology of privacy harms elucidates why certain types of privacy harms should be recognized as cognizable. The second contribution is providing an approach to when privacy harm should be required. In many cases, harm should not be required because it is irrelevant to the purpose of the lawsuit. Currently, much privacy litigation suffers from a misalignment of enforcement goals and remedies. We contend that the law should be guided by the essential question: When and how should privacy regulation be enforced? We offer an approach that aligns enforcement goals with appropriate remedies.</br></br> Text: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3782222#" target="_blank">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3782222#</a></div>

This makes censorship much more costly, because it prevents censors from selectively blocking only those servers used to provide Internet freedom. Instead, whole networks outside the censored country provide Internet freedom to users—and any encrypted data exchange between a censored nation’s Internet and a participating friendly network can become a conduit for the free flow of information.</br></br>Text: <a href="https://refraction.network/">https://refraction.network/</a></div>

      <div class="expanding-element hidden">As the adage goes, there's no such thing as perfect security. And feeling invincible could get you in trouble. End-to-end encryption transforms messages into unintelligible chunks of data as soon as a user presses send. From there, the message isn't reconstituted into something understandable until it reaches the receiver's device. Along the way, the message is unreadable, protected from prying eyes. It essentially amounts to a bodyguard who picks you up at your house, rides around with you in your car, and walks you to the door of wherever you're going. You're safe during the transport, but your vigilance shouldn't end there. [...] It's easy to forget in practice that people you message with could show the chat to someone else, take screenshots, or retain the conversation on their device indefinitely. You also need to keep track of how many devices you've stored your encrypted messages on. If you sync chats between, say, your smartphone and your laptop, or back them up in the cloud, there are potentially more opportunities for the data to be exposed. Your chats may be encrypted, but your backups may not.</br></br> Text: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/encrypted-messaging-isnt-magic/" target="_blank">https://joindeleteme.com/blog/opt-out-guides/</a></div>

        <div class="expanding-element hidden">Facebook Connect, also called Log in with Facebook, is a set of authentication APIs from Facebook that developers can use to help their users connect and share with such users' Facebook friends (on and off Facebook) and increase engagement for their website or application. When so used, Facebook members can log on to third-party websites, applications, mobile devices and gaming systems with their Facebook identity and, while logged in, can connect with friends via these media and post information and updates to their Facebook profile. But sometimes, especially on lesser known websites, using Facebook's universal login feature may carry security risks, according to research from Princeton University. The tracking scripts documented by Steven Englehardt, Gunes Acar, and Arvind Narayanan represent a small slice of the invisible tracking ecosystem that follows users around the web largely without their knowledge. Facebook says the ability to scrape data through Facebook Connect has been patched. </br></br> Text: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/security-risks-of-logging-in-with-facebook/" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/story/security-risks-of-logging-in-with-facebook/</a></div>

The Do Not Track header was originally proposed in 2009. In 2020, a coalition of US-based internet companies announced the Global Privacy Control header that spiritually succeeds Do Not Track header. GPC is a valid do-not-sell-my-personal-information signal according to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which stipulates that websites are legally required to respect a signal sent by users who want to opt-out of having their personal data sold. In July 2021, the California Attorney General clarified through an FAQ that under law, the Global Privacy Control signal must be honored.</br></br>Text: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track</a></div>

This is still a simple explanation for how Tor works today. [...] Tor Browser prevents someone watching your connection from knowing what websites you visit. All anyone monitoring your browsing habits can see is that you're using Tor. Tor Browser isolates each website you visit so third-party trackers and ads can't follow you. Any cookies automatically clear when you're done browsing. So will your browsing history. Tor Browser aims to make all users look the same, making it difficult for you to be fingerprinted based on your browser and device information. Your traffic is relayed and encrypted three times as it passes over the Tor network. The network is comprised of thousands of volunteer-run servers known as Tor relays. With Tor Browser, you are free to access sites your home network may have blocked.</br></br> Text: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">https://www.torproject.org/</a></br>Download: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" target="_blank">https://www.torproject.org/download/</a></div>

  <div class="expanding-element hidden">In a number of areas – privacy, personalisation and community – there are opportunities to improve user experience of the Internet. Users are often concerned about giving there personal details over the internet because of problems related to privacy and misuse of information. These concerns go beyond hacking and fraud and include the tracking of browsing habits and personal information without individuals’ knowledge. In the US double -click ran into considerable bad publicity over their plans to misuse their user data. Along with these problems, there are a number of new internet technologies with offer the opportunity to improve the internet user experience. Two examples of this are new personalisation technology, and new peer-to-peer sharing systems. New personalisation technologies offer the possibility of presenting timely personalised information. By tracking individuals purchases and tastes it is possible that these systems could begin to manage more of the internet user experience.

  <div class="expanding-element hidden">The “privacy paradox” is the phenomenon where people say that they value privacy highly, yet in their behavior relinquish their personal data for very little in exchange or fail to use measures to protect their privacy. Managing one’s privacy is a vast, complex, and never-ending project that does not scale; it becomes virtually impossible to do comprehensively. Privacy regulation often seeks to give people more privacy self-management, such as the recent California Consumer Privacy Act. Professor Solove argues that giving individuals more tasks for managing their privacy will not provide effective privacy protection. Instead, regulation should employ a different strategy — focus on regulating the architecture that structures the way information is used, maintained, and transferred.</br></br>Text: <a href="https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/faculty_publications/1482/" target="_blank">https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/faculty_publications/1482/</a></div>
