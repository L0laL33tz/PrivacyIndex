PrivacyIndex is a non-exhaustive, work in progress archive of tools, articles, research and discussions to help you keep your digital life private. Designed as a digital scrapbook, all indexed items are tagged with the threat models that each entry addresses. If you are new to privacy, start by defining your threat model.
A threat model is the type of attacker you want to protect yourself against. Whether you want to protect yourself against a nosy neighbor, a rogue corporation or a nation state, each threat vector comes with different routes to protection and trade-offs. Some threat vectors are easier to protect against, some are harder, and some may be plain impossible to advert. But we don't want you to take our word for it. Privacy is hard, and many privacy professionals have different opinions on tools, strategies and action plans. PrivacyIndex exists to give you a broad overview of the tools available, the threats that emerge, and what privacy professionals have to say about them.
Use the tag function to navigate the content on this page, search for topics via the topics tag cloud or the search bar, or simply scroll through the privacy tools available to see which fit your threat vector best.
