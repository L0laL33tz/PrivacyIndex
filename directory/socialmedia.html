    <div class="expanding-element hidden">Saudi Arabia has sentenced a secondary schoolgirl to 18 years in jail and a travel ban for posting tweets in support of political prisoners, according to a rights group. Saudi human rights defenders and lawyers, however, disputed Mohammed bin Salman's allegations and said the crackdown on social media users is correlated with his ascent to power and the introduction of new judicial bodies that have since overseen a crackdown on his critics. "He is able, with one word or the stroke of a pen, in seconds, to change the laws if he wants," Taha al-Hajji, a Saudi lawyer and legal consultant with the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, told Middle East Eye this week.</br></br> Text: <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-arabia-sentences-schoolgirl-18-years-tweets" target="_blank">https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-arabia-sentences-schoolgirl-18-years-tweets</a></div>

    <div class="expanding-element hidden">A Nebraska mother who helped her teenage daughter obtain abortion pills to end her pregnancy and later disposed of the fetus’ remains was sentenced to two years in prison on Friday, according to multiple reports, after breaking a state law that banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Police said that while executing a search warrant they discovered evidence of internet searches related to medications “which could be used for the purpose of causing a miscarriage,” or abortion pills. Officers also said they found messages discussing the use of that medication after obtaining Facebook messages from Meta.</br></br> Text: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anafaguy/2023/09/22/nebraska-mom-who-gave-teen-daughter-abortion-pills-sentenced-to-two-years-in-prison/?sh=1518bdf7b1db" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/anafaguy/2023/09/22/nebraska-mom-who-gave-teen-daughter-abortion-pills-sentenced-to-two-years-in-prison/?sh=1518bdf7b1db</a></div>

      <div class="expanding-element hidden">Facebook Connect, also called Log in with Facebook, is a set of authentication APIs from Facebook that developers can use to help their users connect and share with such users' Facebook friends (on and off Facebook) and increase engagement for their website or application. When so used, Facebook members can log on to third-party websites, applications, mobile devices and gaming systems with their Facebook identity and, while logged in, can connect with friends via these media and post information and updates to their Facebook profile. But sometimes, especially on lesser known websites, using Facebook's universal login feature may carry security risks, according to research from Princeton University. The tracking scripts documented by Steven Englehardt, Gunes Acar, and Arvind Narayanan represent a small slice of the invisible tracking ecosystem that follows users around the web largely without their knowledge. Facebook says the ability to scrape data through Facebook Connect has been patched. </br></br> Text: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/security-risks-of-logging-in-with-facebook/" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/story/security-risks-of-logging-in-with-facebook/</a></div>
