  <div class="expanding-element hidden">A team of researchers in the UK found “problematic practices, including inconsistencies” regarding data privacy in several female health apps. They presented the research at the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Honolulu, Hawaii in the US this month. The researchers analysed 20 popular female health apps available on the US and UK Google Play Stores providing a service related to female reproductive health. They looked at the applications’ data privacy policies and practices. </p><p>Read the article: <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/05/31/female-health-apps-arent-doing-enough-to-protect-sensitive-data-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/05/31/female-health-apps-arent-doing-enough-to-protect-sensitive-data-study-says</a></div>

  <div class="expanding-element hidden">A Nebraska mother who helped her teenage daughter obtain abortion pills to end her pregnancy and later disposed of the fetus’ remains was sentenced to two years in prison on Friday, according to multiple reports, after breaking a state law that banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Police said that while executing a search warrant they discovered evidence of internet searches related to medications “which could be used for the purpose of causing a miscarriage,” or abortion pills. Officers also said they found messages discussing the use of that medication after obtaining Facebook messages from Meta.</br></br> Text: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anafaguy/2023/09/22/nebraska-mom-who-gave-teen-daughter-abortion-pills-sentenced-to-two-years-in-prison/?sh=1518bdf7b1db" target="_blank">https://www.forbes.com/sites/anafaguy/2023/09/22/nebraska-mom-who-gave-teen-daughter-abortion-pills-sentenced-to-two-years-in-prison/?sh=1518bdf7b1db</a></div>

Saudi human rights defenders and lawyers, however, disputed Mohammed bin Salman's allegations and said the crackdown on social media users is correlated with his ascent to power and the introduction of new judicial bodies that have since overseen a crackdown on his critics.

    <div class="expanding-element hidden">Privacy is disappearing. From our sex lives to our workout routines, the details of our lives once relegated to pen and paper have joined the slipstream of new technology. As new technologies invite new violations, people have power over one another like never before, from revenge porn to blackmail, attaching life-altering risks to growing up, dating online, or falling in love. The Fight for Privacy takes the focus off Silicon Valley moguls to investigate the price we pay as technology migrates deeper into every aspect of our lives: entering our bedrooms and our bathrooms and our midnight texts; our relationships with friends, family, lovers, and kids; and even our relationship with ourselves.

  <div class="expanding-element hidden">In Surveillance Valley: The Secret Military History of the Internet, Yasha Levine traces the history of the internet back to its beginnings as a Vietnam-era tool for spying on guerrilla fighters and antiwar protesters–a military computer networking project that ultimately envisioned the creation of a global system of surveillance and prediction. Levine shows how the same military objectives that drove the development of early internet technology are still at the heart of Silicon Valley today. Spies, counterinsurgency campaigns, hippie entrepreneurs, privacy apps funded by the CIA. From the 1960s to the 2010s — this revelatory and sweeping story will make you reconsider what you know about the most powerful, ubiquitous tool ever created.</br></br>Text: <a href="http://surveillancevalley.com/">http://surveillancevalley.com/</a></div>

  <div class="expanding-element hidden">As the adage goes, there's no such thing as perfect security. And feeling invincible could get you in trouble. End-to-end encryption transforms messages into unintelligible chunks of data as soon as a user presses send. From there, the message isn't reconstituted into something understandable until it reaches the receiver's device. Along the way, the message is unreadable, protected from prying eyes. It essentially amounts to a bodyguard who picks you up at your house, rides around with you in your car, and walks you to the door of wherever you're going. You're safe during the transport, but your vigilance shouldn't end there. [...] It's easy to forget in practice that people you message with could show the chat to someone else, take screenshots, or retain the conversation on their device indefinitely. You also need to keep track of how many devices you've stored your encrypted messages on. If you sync chats between, say, your smartphone and your laptop, or back them up in the cloud, there are potentially more opportunities for the data to be exposed. Your chats may be encrypted, but your backups may not.</br></br> Text: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/encrypted-messaging-isnt-magic/" target="_blank">https://joindeleteme.com/blog/opt-out-guides/</a></div>

    <div class="expanding-element hidden">Facebook Connect, also called Log in with Facebook, is a set of authentication APIs from Facebook that developers can use to help their users connect and share with such users' Facebook friends (on and off Facebook) and increase engagement for their website or application. When so used, Facebook members can log on to third-party websites, applications, mobile devices and gaming systems with their Facebook identity and, while logged in, can connect with friends via these media and post information and updates to their Facebook profile. But sometimes, especially on lesser known websites, using Facebook's universal login feature may carry security risks, according to research from Princeton University. The tracking scripts documented by Steven Englehardt, Gunes Acar, and Arvind Narayanan represent a small slice of the invisible tracking ecosystem that follows users around the web largely without their knowledge. Facebook says the ability to scrape data through Facebook Connect has been patched. </br></br> Text: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/security-risks-of-logging-in-with-facebook/" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/story/security-risks-of-logging-in-with-facebook/</a></div>

    <div class="expanding-element hidden">The Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2710 (2002)) was passed in reaction to the disclosure of Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork's video rental records in a newspaper. The Act is not often invoked, but stands as one of the strongest protections of consumer privacy against a specific form of data collection. Generally, it prevents disclosure of personally identifiable rental records of "prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual material." The act was envoked in 2008 in a class action law suit against Blockbuster Inc. over participation in Facebook's discontinued Beacon Program , which formed part of Facebook's advertisement system that sent data from external websites to Facebook for the purpose of allowing targeted advertisements and allowing users to share their activities with their friends. Beacon reported to Facebook on Facebook's members' activities on third-party sites that also participated with Beacon even when users were not connected to Facebook, and happened without the knowledge of the Facebook user. A similar lawsuit was brought against Netflix in 2009, when it disclosed insufficiently anonymous information about nearly half-a-million customers as part of its $1 million contest to improve its recommendation system leading to the alleged outing of a lesbian mother.</br></br> Text: <a href="https://archive.epic.org/privacy/vppa/" target="_blank">https://archive.epic.org/privacy/vppa/</a></div>
