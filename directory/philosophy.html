        	<div class="expanded"><p>"Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy.  A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world."</p><p>Eric Hughes is an American mathematician, computer programmer, and cypherpunk. He is considered one of the founders of the cypherpunk movement, alongside Timothy C. May and John Gilmore. He is notable for founding and administering the Cypherpunk mailing list, authoring A Cypherpunk's Manifesto, creating and hosting the first anonymous remailer, and coining the motto, "Cypherpunks write code".</p> Read the full text <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather."<p>"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace" is a widely distributed early paper on the applicability (or lack thereof) of government to the rapidly growing Internet. Commissioned for the pioneering Internet project 24 Hours in Cyberspace, it was written by John Perry Barlow, a founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and published online on February 8, 1996, from Davos, Switzerland. It was written primarily in response to the passing into law of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in the United States. In 2014, the Department of Records recorded and released audio and video content of Barlow reading the Declaration.</p><p>Read the full text <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"">here.</a> Description source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_Cyberspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p></div>

        	<div class="expanded"><p>"Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property."</p><p>Timothy C. May was a political writer, senior engineer at intel, and founder of the crypto anarchist movement, which envisioned a pseudonymous society im cyberspace free from government interference through strong encryption </p><p>Read the manifesto <a href="https://activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>
