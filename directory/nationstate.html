Levine shows how the same military objectives that drove the development of early internet technology are still at the heart of Silicon Valley today. Spies, counterinsurgency campaigns, hippie entrepreneurs, privacy apps funded by the CIA.</p><p>From the 1960s to the 2010s — this revelatory and sweeping story will make you reconsider what you know about the most powerful, ubiquitous tool ever created. </p><p>Buy the book <a href="http://surveillancevalley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>

            <div class="expanded"><p>The Puzzle Palace is a book written by James Bamford and published in 1982. It is the first major, popular work devoted entirely to the history and workings of the National Security Agency (NSA), a United States intelligence organization. The title refers to a nickname for the NSA, which is headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland. In addition to describing the role of the NSA and explaining how it was organized, the book exposed details of a massive eavesdropping operation called Operation Shamrock. According to security expert Bruce Schneier, the book was popular within the NSA itself, as "the agency's secrecy prevents its employees from knowing much about their own history"</p><p>Buy the book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/321214/the-puzzle-palace-by-james-bamford/9780140067484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> Description source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Puzzle_Palace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p>
