    <div class="expanding-element hidden">In Surveillance Valley: The Secret Military History of the Internet, Yasha Levine traces the history of the internet back to its beginnings as a Vietnam-era tool for spying on guerrilla fighters and antiwar protesters–a military computer networking project that ultimately envisioned the creation of a global system of surveillance and prediction. Levine shows how the same military objectives that drove the development of early internet technology are still at the heart of Silicon Valley today. Spies, counterinsurgency campaigns, hippie entrepreneurs, privacy apps funded by the CIA. From the 1960s to the 2010s — this revelatory and sweeping story will make you reconsider what you know about the most powerful, ubiquitous tool ever created.</br></br>Text: <a href="http://surveillancevalley.com/">http://surveillancevalley.com/</a></div>

      <div class="expanding-element hidden">Privacy is disappearing. From our sex lives to our workout routines, the details of our lives once relegated to pen and paper have joined the slipstream of new technology. As new technologies invite new violations, people have power over one another like never before, from revenge porn to blackmail, attaching life-altering risks to growing up, dating online, or falling in love. The Fight for Privacy takes the focus off Silicon Valley moguls to investigate the price we pay as technology migrates deeper into every aspect of our lives: entering our bedrooms and our bathrooms and our midnight texts; our relationships with friends, family, lovers, and kids; and even our relationship with ourselves. Danielle Citron is a professor of law at the University of Virginia and a civil rights advocate.</br></br> Buy the Book: <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-fight-for-privacy-protecting-dignity-identity-and-love-in-the-digital-age-danielle-keats-citron/18092442?ean=9780393882315&ref=&source=IndieBound&title=The+Fight+for+Privacy%3A+Protecting+Dignity%2C+Identity%2C+and+Love+in+the+Digital+Age" target="_blank">https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-fight-for-privacy-protecting-dignity-identity-and-love-in-the-digital-age-danielle-keats-citron/18092442?ean=9780393882315&ref=&source=IndieBound&title=The+Fight+for+Privacy%3A+Protecting+Dignity%2C+Identity%2C+and+Love+in+the+Digital+Age</a></div>

      <div class="expanding-element hidden">The Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2710 (2002)) was passed in reaction to the disclosure of Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork's video rental records in a newspaper. The Act is not often invoked, but stands as one of the strongest protections of consumer privacy against a specific form of data collection. Generally, it prevents disclosure of personally identifiable rental records of "prerecorded video cassette tapes or similar audio visual material." The act was envoked in 2008 in a class action law suit against Blockbuster Inc. over participation in Facebook's discontinued Beacon Program , which formed part of Facebook's advertisement system that sent data from external websites to Facebook for the purpose of allowing targeted advertisements and allowing users to share their activities with their friends. Beacon reported to Facebook on Facebook's members' activities on third-party sites that also participated with Beacon even when users were not connected to Facebook, and happened without the knowledge of the Facebook user. A similar lawsuit was brought against Netflix in 2009, when it disclosed insufficiently anonymous information about nearly half-a-million customers as part of its $1 million contest to improve its recommendation system leading to the alleged outing of a lesbian mother.</br></br> Text: <a href="https://archive.epic.org/privacy/vppa/" target="_blank">https://archive.epic.org/privacy/vppa/</a></div>
