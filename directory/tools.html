        	<div class="expanded"><p>OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using the Tor network.</p>
			<p>Ever wanted to share something without also sharing it with Google or Dropbox? Tax documents, medical information, or unpublished research? Share files directly and securely without the middlemen. Set up a dropbox for anyone to send you files anonymously. Host a static website and make it accessible through the Tor Browser without worrying about setting up a server. Create temporary meeting rooms for discussing important information off the record. No accounts required.</p><p>Learn more about Onion Share <a href="https://onionshare.org/">here.</a></p>

        	<div class="expanded"><p>JMP gives you a Canadian or US phone number that is yours to keep. JMP allows you to send and receive text and picture messages using any Jabber client. You can also make and receive phone calls, including receiving voicemails delivered to you as audio recordings and text transcriptions. You can use JMP to communicate with your contacts without them changing anything on their end, just like with any other telephone provider. JMP works wherever you have an Internet connection. JMP can be used alongside, or instead of, a traditional wireless carrier subscription.</p>
			<p>By using a Voice over IP phone number instead of a virtual phone number, you increase your protection against base band hacking software such as Pegasus, which exploit security holes in your mobile phone's processor to gain control over your device. Messages and phone calls sent via JMP are encrypted via XMPP. JMP can be paid with Bitcoin and Monero.</p><p>Get JMP chat <a href="https://jmp.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>

It aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, in the way that standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email currently does for store-and-forward email service, by allowing users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different service provider via online chat, voice over IP, and videotelephony. It therefore serves a similar purpose to protocols like XMPP, but is not based on any existing communication protocol.</p><p>Matrix can be selfhosted and offers many other benefits like bridges to other messengers, such as Telegam. Communication via Matrix messenger is encrypted by default.</p><p>Get Matrix messenger <a href="https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a></p>

Tor protects personal privacy by concealing a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or traffic analysis.

        	<div class="expanded"><p>Snowflake is a software package for assisting others in circumventing internet censorship by relaying data requests. Snowflake relay nodes are meant to be created by people in countries where Tor and Snowflake are not blocked. People under censorship then use a Snowflake client, packaged with the Tor Browser or Onion Browser, to access the Tor network, using Snowflake relays as proxy servers. Access to the Tor network can in turn give access to other blocked services (like blocked websites). A Snowflake node can be created by either installing a browser extension, installing a stand-alone program, or browsing a webpage with an embedded Snowflake relay. The node runs whenever the browser or program is connected to the internet.</p><p>Unlike VPNs, you do not need to install a separate application to connect to a Snowflake proxy and bypass censorship. It is usually a circumvention feature embedded within existing apps. Currently Snowflake is available inside Tor Browser on Desktop and Android, Onion Browser on iOS, and Orbot on Android and iOS. If you have downloaded and installed any of these apps, and they are censored in your country, you can bypass the censorship by activating Snowflake through the apps' settings page.</p><p>Get Snowflake <a href="https://snowflake.torproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here.</a> Description source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p>

            <div class="expanded"><p>EFF released a new version of Privacy Badger that updates how we fight “link tracking” across a number of Google products. With this update Privacy Badger removes tracking from links in Google Docs, Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Images results. Privacy Badger now also removes tracking from links added after scrolling through Google Search results.</p><p>Link tracking is a creepy surveillance tactic that allows a company to follow you whenever you click on a link to leave its website. As we wrote in our original announcement of Google link tracking protection, Google uses different techniques in different browsers. The techniques also vary across Google products. One common link tracking approach surreptitiously redirects the outgoing request through the tracker’s own servers. There is virtually no benefit 1 for you when this happens. The added complexity mostly just helps Google learn more about your browsing.</p><p>Read the announcement <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/new-privacy-badger-prevents-google-mangling-more-your-links-and-invading-your">here</a> or get the tool <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">here.</a></p>
