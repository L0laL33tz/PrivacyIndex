		<h1>Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified and enumerated, and countermeasures prioritized. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker's profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers questions like "Where am I most vulnerable to attack?", "What are the most relevant threats?", and "What do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?".</h1>
		<h1>Conceptually, most people incorporate some form of threat modeling in their daily life and don't even realize it.[citation needed] Commuters use threat modeling to consider what might go wrong during the morning journey to work and to take preemptive action to avoid possible accidents. Children engage in threat modeling when determining the best path toward an intended goal while avoiding the playground bully. In a more formal sense, threat modeling has been used to prioritize military defensive preparations since antiquity.</h1>
		<h1>Threat modeling will help you feel more confident in the things you need to worry about. At the same time, threat modeling is designed to help you feel less paranoid with threats that may not apply to you. We could get hit by a car any day, that doesn't mean that we should use a tank to cross the street. In other scenarios, using a tank to cross the street may very well be justified. By defining your threat model you'll have a better understanding of what tools you should be using and which ones could be overkill.</h1>

        		<div class="expanded"><p>A corporation can usually be defined as an honest but curios adversary as the way data is being used is communicated with users upon signup. Sometimes, however, corporations take it a step further, leading to cases in which customer data is used beyond the agreed upon terms. Though oftentimes subject to lawsuits and revisions, the illicit use of data through corporations goes unnoticed in many cases. If we are transacting sensitive data via corporations, it can therefore be necessary to utilize additional mechanisms to ensure the privacy of our communications.</p>
        		<p>While we may be able to limit what data rogue corporations are able to collect from us, such as the content of messages, our geolocation, or our browser fingerprint through certain tools, we remain unable to protect our metadata, such as whom we are communicating with or what interests us when using a corporation's services, unless we use specialized apps or apply lenghty manual obfuscation techniques.</p>
        		<p>A rogue corporation may be both a passive or an active adversary, as corporations, in some cases, have attempted to obtain information which was not deemed for their knowledge. Learn more via the tag above.</p>

        	<div class="grid-item" onclick="expandText(this)">With Small to Medium Sized Financial and Diplomatic Means           
        		<div class="expanded"><p>A nation state generally controls all infrastructure located in its own juristidction. This includes telecommunication infrastructure such as mobile towers or internet service providers such as hosting providers or e-mail providers. This gives nation states the ability to monitor all network traffic, even when using obfuscation techniques such as VPNs or the Tor network. In addition, a nation state may perform both online and physical attacks, such as infecting devices with trojans to monitor your device's activity or  intercept communications in public spaces.</p>
        		<p>Depending on a nation state's financial and diplomatic means, it may additionally obtain the ability to monitor communications beyond its own jurisdiction. This can be achieved by obtaining software for purchase such as data from Team Cymru's networking monitors or NSO group's Pegasus spyware to obtain control over a users phone. It can also be achieved by leveraging diplomatic relationships in which countries share information between each other. Depending on a nation state's finanical and diplomatic means, it may therefore also be able to turn into a global passive adversary.</p>
        		<p>Nation states can be passive and active adversaries. Learn more via the tag above.</p>

        		<div class="expanded"><p>Global passive adversaries are almost always cooperations between nation states enabling participants to monitor global network traffic. However, in some cases, a global adversary may also be a private company. Two examples are the so-called five eyes, an intelligence cooperation between Australia, Canada, UK, USA and New Zealand, as well as Team Cymru, which claims to be able to monitor over 90% of global network traffic.</p>
