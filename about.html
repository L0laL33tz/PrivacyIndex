		<h1>PrivacyIndex is a non-exhaustive, work in progress archive of <span class="tag">tools</span>, <span class="tag"><a href="articles">articles</a></span>, <span class="tag">research</span> and <span class="tag">discussions</span> to help you keep your digital life private. Designed as a digital scrapbook, all indexed items are tagged with the threat models that each entry addresses. If you are new to privacy, start by defining your <span class="tag">threat model</span>.</h1>
		<h1>A threat model is the type of attacker you want to protect yourself against. Whether you want to protect yourself against a <span class="tag">nosy neighbor</span>, a <span class="tag">rogue corporation</span> or a <span class="tag">nation state</span>, each threat vector comes with different routes to protection and trade-offs. Some threat vectors are easier to protect against, some are harder, and some may be plain impossible to advert. But we don't want you to take our word for it. Privacy is hard, and many <span class="tag">privacy professionals</span> have different <span class="tag">opinions</span> on tools, <span class="tag">strategies</span> and <span class="tag">action plans</span>. PrivacyIndex exists to give you a broad overview of the tools available, the threats that emerge, and what privacy professionals have to say about them.</h1>
		<h1>Use the tag function to navigate the content on this page, search for <span class="tag">topics</span> via the topics tag cloud or the search bar, or simply scroll through the privacy tools available to see which fit your threat vector best.

		<h1>If you stumbled accross this project by accident and have no idea why you should care about your personal privacy, we encourage you to start your journey by familiarizing yourself with the <span class="tag">philosophy</span> of privacy and explore real world <span class="tag">cases</span> in which privacy protections are important.</h1>
